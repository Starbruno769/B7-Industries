    <p>Specialization: Military</p>
    <p>Rank: General</p>
    <p>Info:</p>
    <p>Corvus Mason is the no-nonsense head of the Military Division. Currently the highest rank, he calls the shots once the operation has been approved and makes sure everything goes according to plan. If it's done in the MD, he's the one doing it. Getting on his bad side is not recommended.</p>

  <h1>UNDR Suit</h1>
  <p>The UNDR Suit is a light layer of armor that goes beneath any other equipment.</p>
  <p>It has its own shield unit to provide protection in emergencies, keeping the wearer safe for a time.</p>
  <p>The suit has multiple attachment points to allow for modules and equipment to be installed, improving its effectiveness.</p>
  <p>It is standard issue, so almost all soldiers wear it. Even scientists may wear a light version if they feel the need for extra safety.</p>
  <p>However, it is not mass produced. It is instead made individually for each user to ensure conformity and practicality.</p>

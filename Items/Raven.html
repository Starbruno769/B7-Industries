   <h1>"Raven" Air Drone</h1>
   <p> The Raven Air Drone is a small, quick propeller drone used by scouts.</p>
   <p>It's commonly used for recon of an area, and comes with a tagging system that displays spotted enemies on the PROT-0 Visor's HUD.</p>
   <p>It obtained its nickname from folklore and mythology, due to ravens commonly being considered "all seeing".</p>
   <p>The small size allows it to be fired from an arm mounted launcher, or holstered on a BacKit.</p>

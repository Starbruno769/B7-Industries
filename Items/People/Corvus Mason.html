    <p>Bio:</p>
    <p>Corvus Mason is the no-nonsense head of the Military Division.</p>
    <p>Currently the highest rank, he calls the shots once the operation has been approved and makes sure everything goes according to plan.</p>
    <p>If it's done in the MD, he's the one doing it. Getting on his bad side is not recommended.</p>

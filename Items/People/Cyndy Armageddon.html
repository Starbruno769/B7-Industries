    <p>Origin: Texas, United States of America</p>

    <p>Personal Quote: "Mess with my other friends, you're screwed. Mess with Sky, and you're <i>extra</i> screwed"</p>
    <p>Bio:</p>
    <p>Cyndy is a generally kind person who wouldn't hurt a fly unless provoked.
    <br>A perfect representation of "you hurt my friends, I hurt you", it's recommended to stay far away from anyone she has an attachment with, unless you really don't like living.
    <br>She especially has an attachment to Sky, another Intern with the same position.</p>
    <p>She is currently being trained by Director Flare Starborn, who sees potential in her.</p>

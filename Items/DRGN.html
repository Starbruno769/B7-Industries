  <h1>DRGN Class BacKit</h1>
  <p>The DRGN Class BacKit is a strong, heavy kit that is built for defense rather than movement.</p>
  <p>It contains a self-powered shield unit that can protect both the user and their allies within 20 feet, either by direct transmission or dome formation.</p>
  <p>Its wings are big, heavy, and bulletproof. They are not capable of flight, but allow the user to glide short distances.</p>

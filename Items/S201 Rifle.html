  <h1>S201 Standard Assult Rifle</h1>
  <p>The S201 Standard Assault Rifle is an accurate, reliable weapon used by B7's assault teams.</p>
  <p>It is given to every soldier in every team as a default weapon. There is not a single soldier without one in some form.</p>
  <p>It's mass produced due to its relatively cheap cost, making it efficient in almost every way.</p>
  <p>It has gained reputation among the soldiers due to its high customizability and modularity, meaning that every S201 is slightly different.</p>

  <h1>PROT-0</h1>
  <p>Designation: PROT-0</p>
  <p>Type: Visor</p>
  <p>Role: Face Protection</p>
  <p>Info:</p>
  <p>The PROT-0 Visor is a sleek, customizable visor designed for a low profile but high protection.</p>
  <p>It comes with a fully functional, customizable HUD that shows the user information received from their equipment, along with an extendable antenna and headset to allow communication among teammates.</p>
  <p>Like the UNDR Suit, PROT-0 Visors are not mass produced. They are instead made individually for each soldier to maintain low profile.</p>
  <p>They are available as either a standalone visor or as a fully covered helmet, depending on the user's preference.</p>
  <p>The composite visor itself is very sturdy and bulletproof, ensuring the protection of the wearer.</p>
  <p>It is common among soldiers to paint designs on the visors, which is condoned by B7.</p>

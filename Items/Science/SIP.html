    <h1>SIP™</h1>
    <p>SIP™ was a fundraising attempt by B7 that sold an energy drink made by R&D in order to help fund some of the projects.</p>
    <p>It took a while to catch on, eventually becoming quite popular. A large number of people chose it instead of their original choice.
    <br>Unfortunately, it lost traction and is now replaced with other fundraising projects. However, it is still produced and sold, and we appreciate those who still take some time to have a SIP™.</p>
    <p>You absolute legends.</p>

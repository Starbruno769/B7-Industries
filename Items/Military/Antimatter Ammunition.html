  <p>Danger: <b style="color: red;">High</b></p>
  <p>Security: <b style="color: red;">MAXIMUM</b></p>
  <p>Info:</p>
  <p>Our Antimatter Ammunition uses specialized bullets with impact-deactivated containment fields containing high density Antimatter to bypass armor and walls.</p>
  <p>There is very limited supply of it, and is only to be used when conventional means have no effect.
  <br>It is only supplied to the highest ranking teams, and even they only get a small amount of it.
  <br>What little supply we have is protected at all times to ensure it remains under our control, lest someone less lawful gets their hands on it.
  <br>It is extremely fragile. <b style="color: yellow">Handle with care.</b></p>

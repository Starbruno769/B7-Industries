  <h1>S10</h1>
  <p>Designation: S10</p>
  <p>Role: Sidearm</p>
  <p>Info:</p>
  <p>The S10 Sidearm is a small handheld firearm to be used when larger weapons are unviable.</p>
  <p>Similar to the S201, it is mass produced and provided to every soldier.</p>
  <p>They have much less modularity than the S201, so soldiers have taken to putting stickers or painting on them instead.</p>

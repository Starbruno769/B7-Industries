   <h1>"Hare" Land Drone</h1>
   <p>The Hare is a land drone designed for infiltration in urban areas.</p>
   <p>Its small size and high speed makes it hard to spot and harder to catch.</p>
   <p>These attributes have also earned it the nickname "Hare", comparing it to an animal of the same nature.</p>

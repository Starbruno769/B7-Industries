  <h1>BRD</h1>
  <p>Designation: BRD</p>
  <p>Type: BacKit</p>
  <p>Role: Infiltration/Assault</p>
  <p>Info:</p>
  <p>The BRD Class kit is the smallest and lightest.</p>
  <p>It is extremely minimalistic, with only one medium thruster and thin wings.
    Its sleek, minimalist design allows it to fly at high speeds, but is extremely fragile.
    If pushed, it can fly at mach 1, though it may destroy itself in the process.</p>

  <h1>Antimatter Ammunition</h1>
  <h2>WARNING: EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL! ONLY FOR USE IN EMERGENCIES!</h2>
  <p>Our Antimatter Ammunition uses specialized bullets with impact-deactivated containment fields containing high density Antimatter to bypass armor and walls.</p>
  <p>There is very limited supply of it, and is only to be used when conventional means have no effect.</p>
  <p>It is only supplied to the highest ranking teams, and even they only get a small amount of it.</p>
  <p>What little supply we have is protected at all times to ensure it remains under our control, lest someone less lawful gets their hands on it.</p>
  <p>It is extremely fragile. Handle with care.</p>
